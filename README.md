# Simple HRM

A demo Android application for wearable devices that reads and displays heart rate data.

Simple HRM determines if the wearable is being worn using the [TYPE_LOW_LATENCY_OFFBODY_DETECT](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Sensor#TYPE_LOW_LATENCY_OFFBODY_DETECT) sensor and reads heart rate data (as beats per minute) using the [TYPE_HEART_RATE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Sensor#TYPE_HEART_RATE) sensor.
